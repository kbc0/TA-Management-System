# TA Management System - Frontend Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for the TA Management System frontend. The system will support three user types with different privileges:

1. **Teaching Assistants (TAs)**: Focus on managing their assignments, tasks, leave requests, and swap requests
2. **Staff (Instructors)**: Manage courses, assign TAs, create tasks, and review leave/swap requests
3. **Administrators**: Full system access including user management, audit logs, and system configuration

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React.js with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI) v5
- **Form Handling**: Formik with Yup validation
- **API Communication**: Axios
- **Authentication**: JWT with secure HTTP-only cookies
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts for statistics and reports
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in with credentials (email/password)
2. Backend validates credentials and returns JWT token
3. Frontend stores token in HTTP-only cookie
4. Protected routes check for valid token
5. Automatic token refresh mechanism

### Authorization System

- Role-based access control (RBAC) for routes and UI elements
- Permission checks for sensitive operations
- UI elements conditionally rendered based on user role
- Protected route components to prevent unauthorized access

## Conclusion

This development plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for building the TA Management System frontend. By following this plan, we will create a robust, user-friendly application that effectively serves the needs of TAs, staff, and administrators. The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, ensuring that each component is thoroughly validated before moving on to the next phase.

The role-specific features ensure that each user type has access to the tools and information they need, while the authorization system prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality. The consistent UI design and component library will provide a cohesive user experience across the entire application.
